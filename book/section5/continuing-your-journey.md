**Trust over IP (ToIP)**

Trust Over IP (ToIP) comprises over 300 organizations from diverse industries collaborating to advance Decentralized Identity through ideas and software. According to ToIP, “We develop tools and specifications to help communities of any size use digital networks to build and strengthen trust between participants.”

[The ToIP Stack](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/concepts/0289-toip-stack/README.md), published in 2019, describes how the four layers (DIDs, DIDComm Protocol, Data Exchange Protocols, and Application Ecosystems) form a secure, scalable, and interoperable digital trust framework. [Introduction to ToIP, Version 2.0](https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Introduction-to-ToIP-V2.0-2021-11-17.pdf), released in 2021, is an excellent resource for anyone catching up on the Digital Identity problem and solution. Membership options include free Contributor accounts and paid memberships, providing access to ToIP’s resources and Slack channels for collaboration. 

To join Trust Over IP, you need to [create a free Linux Foundation account](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/join) and then complete your ToIP application [here](https://trustoverip.org/get-involved/membership/).  

All members agree to open, non-competitive participation, so please have your legal team review all associated documents during the onboarding process.

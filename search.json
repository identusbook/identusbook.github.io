    "text": "Why write a book?\nWhile learning Smart Contract development on the Cardano blockchain, we had an opportunity (Thank You Tony Rose!) to learn about version 2 of Atala PRISM, a Self-Soveign Identity platform, and we were inspired to focus our sights on building SSI products and tooling.\nIn 2023 we built Csign, a way to privately sign, certity, and verify agreements between parties, using SSI and blockchain. Csign was built on Atala PRISM, which was open sourced and donated to the Hyperledger Foundation, and has now been renamed to Identus.\nWe learned so much by building a real-world project and wanted to share our tricks and tips with other Identus builders, so they could get set up and building quicker than we did.\nThis book was funded by a grant from Project Catalyst, Fund 11. Voted on by Cardano wallet holders, we are honored to be able to capture our experience and make it available to the community. To all those who voted, we humbly thank you for your support!"

    "text": "[SSI Roles/Conceptual Diagram (Triangle of Trust)]\nIssuer:\nThe entity that issues a Verifiable Credential to a Holder. This could be a bank, government agency or anyone that accepts responsibility for making credentials. For example a governmental agency can issue a passport to a citizen, or a gym can issue a membership to a member. The type of agency is not important, only that they issue a credential. This role accepts responsibility for having issued that credential and should look to establish trust and reputation with Holders and Verifiers. The Issuer’s DID will be listed in the Issuer (iss:) field of a Verifiable Credential and can be inspected by anyone wishing to know the origin of the credential.\nHolder:\nA Holder is simply any person or wallet that holds a Verifiable Credential. Verifiable Credentials can represent anything, a gym membership, an accomplishment like a University degree, or a permission set, such as a login or authentication role.\nVerifier:\nA Verifier is any person or wallet that performs a verification on a Verifiable Credential or any of it’s referenced entities. A Verifier might perform a check on cryptographic elements of a VC, or make sure that the Issuer DID belongs to the expected entity. Verifiers usually only care to double check that the Verifiable Credential is legitimate and that the included claims meet their expectations, for example when a bartender checks the age of a patron before serving them alcohol.\nTrust Registry:\nWhen Verifiers need to know who a DID belongs to, there needs to be a way to look up that information. A Trust Registry is a mapping between DIDs and the entities they represent. You can think of this like a phone book for DIDs. Trust Registries need to be trusted themselves, and can be as broad or as specific as they need to be. For example, an Real Estate specific Trust Registry that lists real estate agents can be a way to validate that a particular agent is an accepted member of that industry.",

Each could be used or forked separately but they are designed to work well together.\nPRISM Node:\nPRISM Node implements the did:prism methods and is an interface to multiple VDR (Verifiable Data Registries). The node can resolve PRISM DIDs and write transactions to a blockchain or database. PRISM Node is expected to be online at all times.\nCloud Agent:\nWritten in Scala, the Cloud Agent runs on a server and communicates with clients and peers via a REST API. It is a critical component of an Identus application, able to manage identity wallets and their associated operations, as well as issue Verifiable Credentials. The Cloud Agent is expected to be online at all times.\nEdge Agent:\nEdge Agents give agent capabilities to clients like Websites and mobile apps. They can can never be assumed to be online at any given time, and therefore rely on sending and receiving all communications through an online proxy, the Mediator.\nDIDComm:\nDIDComm is a private, secure, and interoperable protocol for communication between decentralized identities. Identus supports DIDCommV2 and allows peers to pass messages between each other, proxied by the Mediator. Messages contain a to: and from: DID\nMediator:\nMediators act as middlemen between Peer DIDs. In order for any agent to send a message to any other agent, it must know the to and from DIDs of each message. The sender and recipient together make up a cryptographic connection called a DIDPair. Mediators maintain queues of messages for each DIDPair. If an Edge Agent is offline, the Mediator will hold incoming messages for them until the agent is back online and able to receive them. Mediators can deliver messages when polled, or push via Websockets. Mediators are expected to be online at all times and be highly available.\nSince instantiation of Identus Edge Agents requires a Mediator, there are several publicly available Mediator services which make development simple.\n\nPRISM Mediator\nRootsID Mediator\nBlocktrust Mediator\n\nWhile extremely helpful during development, these are not recommended for production Identus deployments as they have no uptime guarantee and will not scale past a small number of concurrent users. We will discuss how to run your own Mediator in Chapter 19\nBuilding Blocks:\nIdentus separates the handling of important SSI operations into separate, focused libraries.\nApollo: Apollo is a cryptographic primitives toolbox, which Identus uses to ensure data integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality.\nCastor: Castor enables creation, management, and resolution of DIDs.\nPollux: Pollux handles all Verifiable Credential operations.\nMercury: Mercury is an interface to the DIDCommV2 protocol, allowing the sending and receiving of messages between DIDs.\nMore info on each of the Building Blocks can be found in the Docs",

These repositories group together different building blocks to provide the necessary functionality for fulfilling each of the essential roles in Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), as introduced in Identus Concepts and SSI Basics. Throughout this book, we will detail the setup of each component.\nThe initial component to set up is our Cloud Agent. This agent is responsible for creating and publishing DID Documents into a Verifiable Data Registry (VDR), issuing Verifiable Credentials, and, depending on the configuration, even providing Identity Wallets to multiple users through a multi-tenancy setup. For now, our focus will be on setting up the Cloud Agent to run locally in development mode, supporting only a single tenant. This step is crucial for learning the basics and getting started. As we progress and build our example application, we will deploy the Cloud Agent in development mode first, then set it up to connect to Cardano testnet as our VDR on pre-production mode and, finally, in production mode with multi-tenancy support connected to Cardano mainnet. This will be a gradual process as we need to familiarize on each stage of the Cloud Agent.",

As of this writing, projects are transitioning from Atala PRISM’s original repositories to Hyperledger ones, with the Cloud Agent being the first to migrate. For more details, you can read the press release here.\nIf you’re using a UNIX-based system (such as OS X or Linux), you likely already have git installed. If not, you can download the installer from Git downloads. Additionally, various GUI clients are available for those who prefer a graphical interface.\nTo clone the Cloud Agent repository, first go to the Releases page and identify the tagged release corresponding to the Identus release you are targeting (e.g. cloud-agent-v1.33.0 is part of Identus v2.12 release), then clone the repository with this command:\ngit clone --depth 1 --branch cloud-agent-v1.33.0 https://github.com/hyperledger/identus-cloud-agent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nUsing --depth 1 will skip the history of changes in the repository up until the point of the tag, this is optional.\n\n\n\n\n8.3.2 Docker\nThe Cloud Agent and Mediator are distributed as Docker containers, which is the recommended method for starting and stopping the various components required to run the cloud infrastructure.\nTo begin, install Docker Desktop, which provides everything you need to get started.\n\n\n8.3.3 WSL\nFor Windows users, please refer to How to install Linux on Windows with WSL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWindows is the least tested environment, the community has already found some issues and workarounds on how to get the Cloud Agent working.

    "text": "8.4 Before We Run The Agent\nOnce you have cloned the identus-cloud-agent repository and Docker is up and running you can jump right ahead and run the agent, but before we do that if you are not yet familiar with the community projects or the structure of the agent itself, we recommend you to spend a little time exploring the following information, this is optional and you can skip it.\n\n8.4.1 Atala Community Projects\nThere is a growing list of community repositories that aim to provide some extra functionality, mostly maintained by official developers and community members on their spare time. At present time there are three Atala Community Projects:\n\nPluto Encrypted: Implementation of Pluto storage engine with encryption support.\nEdge Agent SDK Demos: Browser and Node versions of Edge Agent SDK integrated with Pluto Encrypted.\nIdentus Test: Shell script helper that will checkout a particular Identus release and compatible components.\n\n\n\n8.4.2 Exploring The Repository\nThere are two fundamental directories inside the repository if you are an end user.\n\ndocs Where all the latest technical documentation will be available, this includes the Architecture Decision Records (ADR), general insights, guides to deploy, examples and tutorials about how to handle VC Schemas, Connections, secrets, etc. We will do our best to explain in detail all this procedures as we build our example app.\ninfrastructure This directory holds the agent’s Docker file and related scripts to run the agent in different modes such as dev, local or multi. The way to change the agent setup is by customizing environmental variables trough the Docker file, so we really advice you to get familiar with the shared directory content, because that’s the base for every other mode, in essence, every mode is a customization of the shared Docker file.\n\nOur first mode to explore and the simplest one should be local mode, which by default will run a single agent as a single-tenant, meaning that this instance will control only a single Identity Wallet that will be automatically created and seeded upon the first start of the agent.\nThe multi mode essentially runs 3 different local agents but each is assigned a particular role such as issuer, holder and verifier. This is useful in order try test more complex interactions between independent actors.\nFinally the dev mode is meant to be used for development and provides an easy way to modify the Cloud Agent source code, it does not rely on the pre-built Docker images that the local mode fetches and run. We will not use this mode at all trough the book but feel free to explore this option if you would like to make contributions to the Cloud Agent in the future.",

HashiCorp is a secrets storage engine and it will become relevant later on when we need to prepare the agent to run in prepod and production modes, for now the local mode will ignore this value because by default it will use a local postgres database for it’s secret storage engine.\nThe run.sh script options:\n./run.sh --help\nRun an instance of the ATALA bulding-block stack locally\n\nSyntax: run.sh [-n/--name NAME|-p/--port PORT|-b/--background|-e/--env|-w/--wait|--network|-h/--help]\noptions:\n-n/--name              Name of this instance - defaults to dev.\n-p/--port              Port to run this instance on - defaults to 80.\n-b/--background        Run in docker-compose daemon mode in the background.\n-e/--env               Provide your own .env file with versions.\n-w/--wait              Wait until all containers are healthy (only in the background).\n--network              Specify a docker network to run containers on.\n--webhook              Specify webhook URL for agent events\n--webhook-api-key      Specify api key to secure webhook if required\n--debug                Run additional services for debug using docker-compose debug profile.\n-h/--help              Print this help text.\nFor our first interaction with agent all we have to do is to call the run script, if you have any conflicts with the port 80 already in use you can pass --port 8080 or any other available port that you would like to use.\nSo, from the root of the repository you can run:\n./infrastructure/local/run.sh\nThis will take a while the first time as Docker will fetch the required container images and get them running. To check the status of the Cloud Agent you can use curl or open a browser window at same endpoint URL (make sure to replace port 80 if you changed it in the previous step):\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:80/cloud-agent/_system/health\n{\"version\":\"1.33.0\"}\nThe version should match the version of the Cloud Agent defined in the .envfile.\nCongratulations! you have successfully setup the agent in local mode. Next we will explore our Docker file in detail and interact with our agent using the REST API.",

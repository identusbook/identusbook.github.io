## Overview - Airline Ticket Wallet

One of the best ways to learn and understand a software platform is to build something with it.  In the following chapters, we will build an example application showing how to use Identus to issue and verify airline tickets. 

Users will be able to purchase a flight, and receive a Verifiable Credential representing a ticket and seat assignment. Travelers will be able to present their ticket to Airport Security when requested, and in turn, the security officer will be able to verify the ticket's authenticity.

We will use the Identus Cloud Agent, plus the Typescript SDK in our examples, however the same functionality and source is available in the native language of each Edge Agent SDK; Swift for iOS/Mac and Kotlin for Android. Please see the book's Github page for the complete source code and follow along in your language of choice.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with the book, please make sure you have a working Cloud Agent development environment, as described in the [Section 2](../section2/installation-local.md).

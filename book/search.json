If you’re new to the idea of SSI or Identus, we reccomend the exellent resources listed below as a pre-requisite to this text.\n\nSelf-Sovereign Identity by Alex Preukschat, Drummond Reed, et al. This is the definitive book on SSI and it’s ecosystem of topics.\nAtala PRISM Documentation\n\nIt should be noted that Identus is still new and at the time of writing this book, there are very few best practices, in fact, very little practices at all. A handfull of advanturous developers have been building on the platform and sharing their experiences, and we hope to share our own learnings in hopes of magnifying that knowledge and helping developers skip the common pitfalls and bring their ideas to market.\nWe hope this text will be accessible to anyone who’s curious about what’s\nWe hope that newcomers will be able to use this text to skip common pitfalls and misunderstandings, and bring their ideas to market faster.\nWe’re glad you could join us :)",

    "text": "[SSI Roles/Conceptual Diagram (Triangle of Trust)]\nIssuer:\nThe entity that issues a Verifiable Credential to a Holder. This could be a bank, government agency or anyone that accepts responsibility for making credentials. For example a governmental agency can issue a passport to a citizen, or a gym can issue a membership to a member. The type of agency is not important, only that they issue a credential. This role accepts responsibility for having issued that credential and should look to establish trust and reputation with Holders and Verifiers. The Issuer’s DID will be listed in the Issuer (iss:) field of a Verifiable Credential and can be inspected by anyone wishing to know the origin of the credential.\nHolder:\nA Holder is simply any person or wallet that holds a Verifiable Credential. Verifiable Credentials can represent anything, a gym membership, an accomplishment like a University degree, or a permission set, such as a login or authentication role.\nVerifier:\nA Verifier is any person or wallet that performs a verification on a Verifiable Credential or any of it’s referenced entities. A Verifier might perform a check on cryptographic elements of a VC, or make sure that the Issuer DID belongs to the expected entity. Verifiers usually only care to double check that the Verifiable Credential is legitimate and that the included claims meet their expectations, for example when a bartender checks the age of a patron before serving them alcohol.\nTrust Registry:\nWhen Verifiers need to know who a DID belongs to, there needs to be a way to look up that information. A Trust Registry is a mapping between DIDs and the entities they represent. You can think of this like a phone book for DIDs. Trust Registries need to be trusted themselves, and can be as broad or as specific as they need to be. For example, an Real Estate specific Trust Registry that lists real estate agents can be a way to validate that a particular agent is an accepted member of that industry.",

    "text": "[Identus Application Architecture Diagram]\nIdentus is made up of several open source components. Each could be used or forked separately but they are designed to work well together.\nPRISM Node:\nPRISM Node implements the did:prism methods and is an interface to multiple VDR (Verifiable Data Registries). The node can resolve PRISM DIDs and write transactions to a blockchain or database. PRISM Node is expected to be online at all times.\nCloud Agent:\nWritten in Scala, the Cloud Agent runs on a server and communicates with clients and peers via a REST API. It is a critical component of an Identus application, able to manage identity wallets and their associated operations, as well as issue Verifiable Credentials. The Cloud Agent is expected to be online at all times.\nEdge Agent:\nEdge Agents give agent capabilities to clients like Websites and mobile apps. They can can never be assumed to be online at any given time, and therefore rely on sending and receiving all communications through an online proxy, the Mediator.\nDIDComm:\nDIDComm is a private, secure, and interoperable protocol for communication between decentralized identities. Identus supports DIDCommV2 and allows peers to pass messages between each other, proxied by the Mediator. Messages contain a to: and from: DID\nMediator:\nMediators act as middlemen between Peer DIDs. In order for any agent to send a message to any other agent, it must know the to and from DIDs of each message. The sender and recipient together make up a cryptographic connection called a DIDPair. Mediators maintain queues of messages for each DIDPair. If an Edge Agent is offline, the Mediator will hold incoming messages for them until the agent is back online and able to receive them. Mediators can deliver messages when polled, or push via Websockets. Mediators are expected to be online at all times and be highly available.\nSince instantiation of Identus Edge Agents requires a Mediator, there are several publicly available Mediator services which make development simple.\n\nPRISM Mediator\nRootsID Mediator\nBlocktrust Mediator\n\nWhile extremely helpful during development, these are not recommended for production Identus deployments as they have no uptime guarantee and will not scale past a small number of concurrent users. We will discuss how to run your own Mediator in Chapter 19\nBuilding Blocks:\nIdentus separates the handling of important SSI operations into separate, focused libraries.\nApollo: Apollo is a cryptographic primitives toolbox, which Identus uses to ensure data integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality.\nCastor: Castor enables creation, management, and resolution of DIDs.\nPollux: Pollux handles all Verifiable Credential operations.\nMercury: Mercury is an interface to the DIDCommV2 protocol, allowing the sending and receiving of messages between DIDs.\nMore info on each of the Building Blocks can be found in the Docs",

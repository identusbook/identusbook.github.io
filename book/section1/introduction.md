#  Introduction {#sec-introduction}

This is a developer-centric book about creating and launching Self-Sovereign applications with Identus.  We aim to show the reader how to configure, build and deploy a complex idea from scratch.  

This is not a book about Self-Sovereign Identity.  There are already great resources available on that topic.  If you're new to the idea of SSI or Identus, we recommend the excellent resources listed below as a pre-requisite to this text.


- [Self-Sovereign Identity](https://www.manning.com/books/self-sovereign-identity) by Alex Preukschat, Drummond Reed, et al.  This is the definitive book on SSI and it's ecosystem of topics.  

- [Identus Documentation](https://hyperledger-identus.github.io/docs/)

It should be noted that Identus is still new and at the time of writing this book, there are very few best practices, in fact, very little practices at all.  A handful of adventurous developers have been building on the platform and sharing their experiences, and we hope to share our own learnings in hopes of magnifying that knowledge and helping developers skip the common pitfalls and bring their ideas to market.

We hope this text will be accessible to anyone who's curious about what's 

We hope that newcomers will be able to use this text to skip common pitfalls and misunderstandings, and bring their ideas to market faster. 

We're glad you could join us :)

# Glossary {#sec-glossary .unnumbered}

Glossary or Index here

This will reference key concepts and Identus terms and where they are mentioned in the book, allowing someone to look up a term and know what section it is referenced in.

TODO: First draft will just lay down the glossary terms, we want to add detailed descriptions later.

This could be a bank, government agency or anyone that accepts responsibility for making credentials. For example a governmental agency can issue a passport to a citizen, or a gym can issue a membership to a member. The type of agency is not important, only that they issue a credential. This role accepts responsibility for having issued that credential and should look to establish trust and reputation with Holders and Verifiers. The Issuer’s DID will be listed in the Issuer (iss:) field of a Verifiable Credential and can be inspected by anyone wishing to know the origin of the credential.\nHolder:\nA Holder is simply any person or wallet that holds a Verifiable Credential. Verifiable Credentials can represent anything, a gym membership, an accomplishment like a University degree, or a permission set, such as a login or authentication role.\nVerifier:\nA Verifier is any person or wallet that performs a verification on a Verifiable Credential or any of it’s referenced entities. A Verifier might perform a check on cryptographic elements of a VC, or make sure that the Issuer DID belongs to the expected entity. Verifiers usually only care to double check that the Verifiable Credential is legitimate and that the included claims meet their expectations, for example when a bartender checks the age of a patron before serving them alcohol.\nTrust Registry:\nWhen Verifiers need to know who a DID belongs to, there needs to be a way to look up that information. A Trust Registry is a mapping between DIDs and the entities they represent. You can think of this like a phone book for DIDs. Trust Registries need to be trusted themselves, and can be as broad or as specific as they need to be. For example, an Real Estate specific Trust Registry that lists real estate agents can be a way to validate that a particular agent is an accepted member of that industry.",

Each could be used or forked separately but they are designed to work well together.\nPRISM Node:\nPRISM Node implements the did:prism methods and is an interface to multiple VDR (Verifiable Data Registries). The node can resolve PRISM DIDs and write transactions to a blockchain or database. PRISM Node is expected to be online at all times.\nCloud Agent:\nWritten in Scala, the Cloud Agent runs on a server and communicates with clients and peers via a REST API. It is a critical component of an Identus application, able to manage identity wallets and their associated operations, as well as issue Verifiable Credentials. The Cloud Agent is expected to be online at all times.\nEdge Agent:\nEdge Agents give agent capabilities to clients like Websites and mobile apps. They can can never be assumed to be online at any given time, and therefore rely on sending and receiving all communications through an online proxy, the Mediator.\nDIDComm:\nDIDComm is a private, secure, and interoperable protocol for communication between decentralized identities. Identus supports DIDCommV2 and allows peers to pass messages between each other, proxied by the Mediator. Messages contain a to: and from: DID\nMediator:\nMediators act as middlemen between Peer DIDs. In order for any agent to send a message to any other agent, it must know the to and from DIDs of each message. The sender and recipient together make up a cryptographic connection called a DIDPair. Mediators maintain queues of messages for each DIDPair. If an Edge Agent is offline, the Mediator will hold incoming messages for them until the agent is back online and able to receive them. Mediators can deliver messages when polled, or push via Websockets. Mediators are expected to be online at all times and be highly available.\nSince instantiation of Identus Edge Agents requires a Mediator, there are several publicly available Mediator services which make development simple.\n\nPRISM Mediator\nRootsID Mediator\nBlocktrust Mediator\n\nWhile extremely helpful during development, these are not recommended for production Identus deployments as they have no uptime guarantee and will not scale past a small number of concurrent users. We will discuss how to run your own Mediator in Chapter 18\nBuilding Blocks:\nIdentus separates the handling of important SSI operations into separate, focused libraries.\nApollo: Apollo is a cryptographic primitives toolbox, which Identus uses to ensure data integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality.\nCastor: Castor enables creation, management, and resolution of DIDs.\nPollux: Pollux handles all Verifiable Credential operations.\nMercury: Mercury is an interface to the DIDCommV2 protocol, allowing the sending and receiving of messages between DIDs.\nMore info on each of the Building Blocks can be found in the Docs",

These repositories group together different building blocks to provide the necessary functionality for fulfilling each of the essential roles in Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), as introduced in Identus Concepts and SSI Basics. Throughout this book, we will detail the setup of each component.\nThe initial component to set up is our Cloud Agent. This agent is responsible for creating and publishing DID Documents into a Verifiable Data Registry (VDR), issuing Verifiable Credentials, and, depending on the configuration, even providing Identity Wallets to multiple users through a multi-tenancy setup. For now, our focus will be on setting up the Cloud Agent to run locally in development mode, supporting only a single tenant. This step is crucial for learning the basics and getting started. As we progress and build our example application, we will deploy the Cloud Agent in development mode first, then set it up to connect to Cardano testnet as our VDR on pre-production mode and, finally, in production mode with multi-tenancy support connected to Cardano mainnet. This will be a gradual process as we need to familiarize on each stage of the Cloud Agent.",

As of this writing, projects are transitioning from Atala PRISM’s original repositories to Hyperledger ones, with the Cloud Agent being the first to migrate. For more details, you can read the press release here.\nIf you’re using a UNIX-based system (such as OS X or Linux), you likely already have git installed. If not, you can download the installer from Git downloads. Additionally, various GUI clients are available for those who prefer a graphical interface.\nTo clone the Cloud Agent repository, first go to the Releases page and identify the tagged release corresponding to the Identus release you are targeting (e.g. cloud-agent-v1.33.0 is part of Identus v2.12 release), then clone the repository with this command:\ngit clone --depth 1 --branch cloud-agent-v1.33.0 https://github.com/hyperledger/identus-cloud-agent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nUsing --depth 1 will skip the history of changes in the repository up until the point of the tag, this is optional.\n\n\n\n\n8.3.2 Docker\nThe Cloud Agent and Mediator are distributed as Docker containers, which is the recommended method for starting and stopping the various components required to run the cloud infrastructure.\nTo begin, install Docker Desktop, which provides everything you need to get started.\n\n\n8.3.3 WSL\nFor Windows users, please refer to How to install Linux on Windows with WSL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWindows is the least tested environment, the community has already found some issues and workarounds on how to get the Cloud Agent working.

At present time there are three Atala Community Projects:\n\nPluto Encrypted: Implementation of Pluto storage engine with encryption support.\nEdge Agent SDK Demos: Browser and Node versions of Edge Agent SDK integrated with Pluto Encrypted.\nIdentus Test: Shell script helper that will checkout a particular Identus release and compatible components.\n\n\n\n8.4.2 Exploring The Repository\nThere are two fundamental directories inside the repository if you are an end user.\n\ndocs Where all the latest technical documentation will be available, this includes the Architecture Decision Records (ADR), general insights, guides to deploy, examples and tutorials about how to handle VC Schemas, Connections, secrets, etc. We will do our best to explain in detail all this procedures as we build our example app.\ninfrastructure This directory holds the agent’s Docker file and related scripts to run the agent in different modes such as dev, local or multi. The way to change the agent setup is by customizing environmental variables trough the Docker file, so we really advise you to get familiar with the shared directory content, because that’s the base for every other mode, in essence, every mode is a customization of the shared Docker file.\n\nOur first mode to explore and the simplest one should be local mode, which by default will run a single agent as a single-tenant, meaning that this instance will control only a single Identity Wallet that will be automatically created and seeded upon the first start of the agent.\nThe multi mode essentially runs 3 different local agents but each is assigned a particular role such as issuer, holder and verifier. This is useful in order try test more complex interactions between independent actors.\nFinally the dev mode is meant to be used for development and provides an easy way to modify the Cloud Agent source code, it does not rely on the pre-built Docker images that the local mode fetches and run. We will not use this mode at all trough the book but feel free to explore this option if you would like to make contributions to the Cloud Agent in the future.",

HashiCorp is a secrets storage engine and it will become relevant later on when we need to prepare the agent to run in prepod and production modes, for now the local mode will ignore this value because by default it will use a local postgres database for it’s secret storage engine.\nThe run.sh script options:\n./run.sh --help\nRun an instance of the ATALA bulding-block stack locally\n\nSyntax: run.sh [-n/--name NAME|-p/--port PORT|-b/--background|-e/--env|-w/--wait|--network|-h/--help]\noptions:\n-n/--name              Name of this instance - defaults to dev.\n-p/--port              Port to run this instance on - defaults to 80.\n-b/--background        Run in docker-compose daemon mode in the background.\n-e/--env               Provide your own .env file with versions.\n-w/--wait              Wait until all containers are healthy (only in the background).\n--network              Specify a docker network to run containers on.\n--webhook              Specify webhook URL for agent events\n--webhook-api-key      Specify api key to secure webhook if required\n--debug                Run additional services for debug using docker-compose debug profile.\n-h/--help              Print this help text.\nFor our first interaction with the agent all we have to do is to call the run script. If you have any conflicts with the port 80 already in use or you don’t want that as the default, you can pass --port 8080 or any other available port that you would like to use.\nSo, from the root of the repository you can run:\n./infrastructure/local/run.sh\nThis will take a while the first time as Docker will fetch the required container images and get them running. To check the status of the Cloud Agent you can use curl or open a browser window at same endpoint URL (make sure to specify a custom port if you changed it in the previous step, e.g. use http://localhost:8080):\ncurl http://localhost/cloud-agent/_system/health\n{\"version\":\"1.33.0\"}\nThe version should match the version of the Cloud Agent defined in the .envfile.\nTo stop the agent, you can press Control + C or run:\n./infrastructure/local/stop.sh\nCongratulations! you have successfully setup the agent in local mode. Next we will explore our Docker file in detail and interact with our agent using the REST API.",

In our initial setup our agent is running on single-tenant mode, therefor it is managing a single default wallet which is assigned the following Entity ID (UUID) 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000. You can confirm this by running the following command:\nLater on the book, once we start building our example app, we will setup the agent in multi-tenant mode, meaning that a single agent instance will be capable of managing multiple wallets, we refer to those wallets as custodian wallets. This more advanced setup is useful when your users would want to delegate their Identity Wallet custody to a service instead of managing the wallet themselves.\nBesides the _system/health endpoint we used earlier to confirm the agent version, there is one more endpoint used to debug runtime metrics:\nThis will be useful when debugging a memory or performance issue or when developing.",

So, let’s try it:\n\nIf you don’t already have it, first you should Download Postman and Sign Up for a free account.\nHead to the API docs and click the Download button, or copy this direct link https://docs.atalaprism.io/redocusaurus/plugin-redoc-0.yaml\nInside Postman, go to File -&gt; Import and either drag & drop your yaml file if you downloaded it or paste the URL in the box, this will auto advance to the next step.\nOn the “How to import” step select “OpenAPI 3.0 with a Postman Collection” and click import.\n\nIf everything goes correctly, you should see “Identus Cloud Agent API Reference” in your collections.",

    "text": "11.1 Introduction\nWallets are an essential component on every Self-Sovereign Identity interaction, and as you might have guessed, just like in the physical world where a wallet holds your identifiers (IDs), a digital SSI wallet’s function is to store and manage Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), cryptographic keys, and other related assets.\nSince many SSI frameworks rely on a Blockchain to publish DIDs, there is a common misconception that SSI wallets work in a similar way. Although both SSI and Blockchain wallets require a seed phrase built from a random set of mnemonics, thats where the overlap ends, because the balance and history of a Blockchain wallet can be restored from the ledger itself as opposed to an SSI wallet, where all the stored information exists only on the device and needs to be manually backed up and restored.\nIn essence, a wallet in SSI is piece of software that allows users to store, manage, and present proof of their digital identities and credentials. It acts as a repository for digital assets required to fulfill every SSI interaction, ensuring that users and entities have complete control over their data. In the case of Identus, the Edge Agent SDK provides all the abstractions needed to operate a wallet by an individual on a browser or mobile app, and the Cloud Agent, provides a REST API to operate a wallet in the cloud, either to itself (single tenant) or for third-parties (multi tenant) as a custodial wallet.",

    "text": "11.2 Edge Agent SDK in Identus\nIdentus provides it’s wallet interface through the Edge Agent SDKs, available in 3 flavors:\n\nTypeScript for Web and Node apps.\nSwift for iOS and Mac.\nKotlin for Android and JVM.\n\nEach of the flavors provide the same building block implementations:\n\nApollo: Provides a suite of necessary cryptographic operations.\nCastor: Provides a suite of operations to create, manage and resolve decentralized identifiers.\nPollux: Provides a suite of operations for handling verifiable credentials.\nMercury: Provides a suite of operations for handling DIDComm V2 messages.\nPluto: Provides an interface for storage operations in a portable, storage-agnostic manner.\nAgent: A component using all other building blocks, provides basic edge agent capabilities, including implementing DIDComm V2 protocols.\n\nAnd all of them abstract the usage of each building block through the Agent component.\nMost of the time you will be operating the wallet trough the Agent interface unless you require to directly call lower level building block API, for example, you may require to send a custom DIDCOMM message payload format which is not directly supported via the Agent building block, you can still use Mercury directly to achieve that. This approach gives you a simple to use interface trough the Agent but also the flexibility and control that comes with also providing access to the lower level APIs. We highly encourage to dig inside each of the building blocks and study how the Agent is using them, this will come handy when you need to add custom features to your own software.\nThere is one building block that is not implemented and only provided as an interface, this is Pluto, the storage layer for DIDs, VCs, messages, keys, etc. Identus does not have an opinion on how you should store and retrieve the contents of the wallet, so it’s your job to implement this part according to your needs. Fortunately, there is a community project providing one implementation called Pluto Encrypted, this project provides 3 different storage engines: InMemory, IndexDB, LevelDB. As the name suggest, Pluto Encrypted provides full Pluto compatibility plus handles encryption and decryption of the wallet contents, this is very important due to the fact that the wallet stores your DIDs (private keys), VCs, messages and a lot of sensitive information. If you are starting out we highly recommend you to use this implementation before attempting to role your own, it’s a great starting place that you can extend and customize to your needs.",

In practice, there are many good reasons why an identity wallet would be better managed by a service. Such is the case for companies and entities or even individuals that don’t want to deal with the responsibility and risk of self-managing their wallets. For this use case Identus provides the concept of Custodial Wallets. What this really means is that an identity wallet can be managed by the Cloud Agent and used over a REST API. For this particular use case, the Cloud Agent supports a multi-tenant mode in order to onboard and serve multiple identity wallets on the same running instance. We will explain the setup in detail over the production installation section, for now the key insight is that when you access your identity wallet through a Cloud Agent, you are really trusting the storage and management of the private keys of your identity to that service.",

This relationship is established using a specific decentralized identifier standard (Peer DID) and is governed by a protocol (DIDCOMM) that ensure the authenticity, integrity, and privacy of the interactions between the connected parties.\nThere are three roles in an SSI connection:\n\nInviter: The entity that initiates the connection by sending an invitation.\nInvitee: The entity that receives the invitation and responds with a connection request.\nMediator: An intermediary that facilitates message delivery between entities, especially when one or both parties may not always be online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe will cover mediators in detail later on.

    "text": "13.3 PeerDIDs\nThey are a special kind of decentralized identifier with some unique properties that allow them to be perfect for use in order to establish private and secure communications between peers.\nDID Documents such as PrismDIDs are meant to be publicly available and resolvable by arbitrary parties, therefor storing them in a VDR such as Cardano blockchain is an excellent way to achieve this requirement in a reliable way.\nHowever, when Alice and Bob want to interact with each other, only two parties care about the details of that connection: Alice and Bob. Instead of arbitrary parties needing to resolve their DIDs, only Alice and Bob do. Thus, PeerDIDs essentially describe a key-pair to encrypt and sign data to and from Alice and Bob, routed trough their preferred mediators, e.g. When Alice accepts an invite from Bob and they engage the connection protocol, Alice generates a PeerDID that allows her to encrypt and sign data routed trough Bob’s mediator (mediator Y) that only Bob can decrypt, and viceversa, Bob will generate a PeerDID that allows him to encrypt and sign data routed trough Alice’s preferred mediator (mediator X) that only Alice can decrypt.\nThe key benefits of PeerDIDs are:\n\nDecentralized by nature.\nNo transaction cost on blockchain.\nPrivate (only the concerned parties know about them).\nReusable without any reliance on the internet, with no degradation of trust. (adheres to the principles of local-first and offline-first)\n\nLets resolve a PeerDID, we call resolve to the unpacking and parsing of a DID in order to read its content and use the DID for the interactions that we need to achieve. For this example we will resolve a PeerDID from Atala’s mediator sandbox.\ncurl https://sandbox-mediator.atalaprism.io/did\n\ndid:peer:2.Ez6LSghwSE437wnDE1pt3X6hVDUQzSjsHzinpX3XFvMjRAm7y.Vz6Mkhh1e5CEYYq6JBUcTZ6Cp2ranCWRrv7Yax3Le4N59R6dd.SeyJ0IjoiZG0iLCJzIjp7InVyaSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vc2FuZGJveC1tZWRpYXRvci5hdGFsYXByaXNtLmlvIiwiYSI6WyJkaWRjb21tL3YyIl19fQ.SeyJ0IjoiZG0iLCJzIjp7InVyaSI6IndzczovL3NhbmRib3gtbWVkaWF0b3IuYXRhbGFwcmlzbS5pby93cyIsImEiOlsiZGlkY29tbS92MiJdfX0\nWe can see that the mediator returned a PeerDID when we send a GET request to the /did endpoint.

    "text": "14.3 Schemas\nIssuing a Verifiable Credential (VC) requires a credential schema, which serves as a general template defining the valid claims (attributes) the VC can contain. This schema acts as a reference point to ensure that the VC is correctly formatted and valid by checking its claims against the predefined structure.\nSchemas can optionally be published on a Verifiable Data Registry (VDR), which is particularly beneficial for widely applicable schema types. Publishing schemas on a VDR facilitates their adoption by other parties, enabling third parties to issue VCs that conform to the same standardized credential format.\nFor example, relevant entities or industry consortiums can collaboratively develop, agree upon, and publish schemas that they will adopt and recognize. This approach encourages other players in the ecosystem to adopt these schemas as well, fostering interoperability and growth within the ecosystem.\nBy standardizing schemas, the VC ecosystem becomes more cohesive and efficient, allowing for easier verification and broader acceptance of credentials across different platforms and organizations.\nExample Credential Schema\n{\n  \"$id\": \"https://example.com/driving-license-1.0\",\n  \"$schema\": \"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema\",\n  \"description\": \"Driving License\",\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"emailAddress\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"format\": \"email\"\n    },\n    \"givenName\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"familyName\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"dateOfIssuance\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"format\": \"date-time\"\n    },\n    \"drivingLicenseID\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"drivingClass\": {\n      \"type\": \"integer\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"emailAddress\",\n    \"familyName\",\n    \"dateOfIssuance\",\n    \"drivingLicenseID\",\n    \"drivingClass\"\n  ],\n  \"additionalProperties\": true\n}\n\nPublishing your Schema (Milestone 3)",

    "text": "18.1 Overview\nA Self-Sovereign Identity Mediator is a service that enables private and secure connections between peers. Its primary function is to relay encrypted messages between DIDs using DIDComm V2 protocols. Since each participant wallet is Self-Sovereign, Mediators help route messages to their intended recipient without any one wallet knowing the details of the other. Encrypted messages can be sent to peers even if they are not online, and the Mediator will manage a queue for the offline party until they are able to connect and retrieve them.\nThink of a Mediator like a set of Post Office mailboxes. Each mailbox has a mailing address (a DID). Each mailbox can hold an stack of incoming mail Encrypted DIDComm V2 messages for its owner. Each mailbox also keeps a list of cryptographic Connections with whom its owner can send or receive mail with. In this way, Identus Mediators facilitate all types of important transactions, including routing both messages, Verifiable Credential issuance, and Credential Exchange.\nWhat’s important is that the Mediator, while messages are routed through it, is not a centralized actor. Mediators can not know the contents of any message, only what DIDs can talk to other DIDs and what encrypted messages they have yet to read.",

    "text": "18.1.1 Why use a Mediator?\nWhy do we need a Mediator in the first place? If participants are Self-Sovereign, then why not connect an edge wallet directly to another edge wallet?\nSSI participants are connected through various types of devices and network conditions. The Cloud Agent, is expected to be online and available all the time, as it’s hosted in a remote server farm somewhere. However users who keep their wallets on mobile devices, or laptop computers, are only online sporadically, and can’t be expected to have a reliable connection to the Internet at all times. This is where Mediators earn their keep. If User A were to send a message to User B, who happens to be offline at the moment, the message could not be delivered, plus User A would also have to know sensitive data about how to contact User B. If User B changes devices, they would have to tell User A, and all other peer Connections. If User A instead, sends the message through the Mediator, it can be held securely and retrieved the next time User B connects to the Internet. Mediators provide reliability between Connections, without compromising privacy or security.",
